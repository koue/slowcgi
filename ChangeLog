	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/: slowcgi.8, slowcgi.c: list -v with -d in
	  SYNOPSIS, instead of seperately, and add -v to usage();

2021-09-02 13:18  florian

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/: slowcgi.8, slowcgi.c: Stop sending debug
	  logging to syslog (which would then drop it on the floor) all the
	  time. Instead debug logging must be requested with the new -v
	  flag.  Problem reported and fix provided by weerd@

2021-04-20 07:35  claudio

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: Use LIST instead of SLIST for
	  requests. The way SLIST_REMOVE was used did a double traverse of
	  the list which now is replaced with no traversal at all.  Also
	  stop double wrapping requests just for the list.  OK millert@

2021-04-20 07:32  claudio

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: Ignore SIGPIPE by default and restore
	  default behaviour before executing the CGI.  OK bluhm@ florian@

2021-01-08 22:05  millert

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: accept_reserve() counter function
	  argument doesn't need to be volatile.  Revision 1.21 removed the
	  volatile from the cgi_inflight global but accept_reserve() was
	  not updated to match.  OK florian@

2020-05-11 10:40  claudio

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: Allow specifying -d multiple times.
	  Only print the fcgi header data if debug > 1 (-dd) since it adds
	  a lot of noise to the output.  In syslog_debug do not check for
	  the debug variable instead let syslog handle it. Currently
	  syslog_debug() would never print anything since it is only called
	  with debug = 0 (debug > 0 implies the console logger).  OK
	  florian@

2020-05-08 07:41  claudio

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: Just a bit of KNF.  OK florian@

2018-10-19 08:13  claudio

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: When calculating the fd limit before
	  accepting a new connection also account for the inflight fds
	  caused by the new connection. Without this slowcgi could fail
	  when close to the limit because FD_RESERVE is smaller then
	  FD_NEEDED.  OK florian@, tested by Kristaps Dzonsons

2018-08-19 12:31  florian

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: Call daemon with 0 as first argument
	  so that it changes the cwd to /.  It is not a problem in slowcgi
	  since it calls chroot(2) and then chdir(2) shortly afterwards but
	  hopefully prevents copying code into daemons where it does
	  matter.  Problem first observed by dlg in ntpd(8) which keeps
	  sitting in the directory from where it was started which might
	  for example prevent an unmount.  Discussed with deraadt@

2018-08-13 16:54  florian

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/: slowcgi.8, slowcgi.c: Make the owner of fcgi
	  socket configurable.

	  Andrew Daugherity (andrew.daugherity AT gmail) pointed out that
	  this is helpful for his port to linux. For example on openSUSE
	  nginx and Apache run as different users so a compile time default
	  user won't cut it.  Man page tweaks jmc@

	  While here, consistently log users at debug level; from Andrew.

2018-08-01 11:47  florian

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.8: Clarify that we chroot to the users
	  home directory if -u is provided.  Pointed out by Andrew
	  Daugherity (andrew.daugherity AT gmail), thanks! Tweaks and OK
	  jmc

2017-10-17 22:47  schwarze

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.8: add missing HISTORY; based on CVS
	  logs and release announcements

2017-07-04 12:48  florian

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: consistently use the evtimer wrappers
	  around the connection timeout.

	  this is instead of setting the timeout up with event_set and
	  event_add, but removing it with evtimer_del. this uses
	  evtimer_set and evtimer_add.

	  prompted by dlg's commit to identd OK dlg

2017-05-26 17:38  florian

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: Sync the severity of the syslog_*
	  functions shared between identd, slowcgi, tftp-proxy and tftpd to
	  the severity used in log.c style loggers.  This also fixes an
	  issue where syslog_err and syslog_errx logged with different
	  severities.

	  Sure deraadt@

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: Add format attribute to logger

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: As suggested by the FastCGI spec,
	  zero-pad the response buffers to be aligned to 8 bytes.  This
	  matches what most other implementations are doing.  While here,
	  make sure that the allocated response buffers are zero'ed out.

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: pledge(2) for slowcgi.  After
	  initialization slowcgi accepts from a AF_UNIX socket, forks and
	  execs. After fork we only need to close(2), chdir(2) and exec.
	  OK benno@

	  improvment and ok florian@

2015-01-16 06:40  deraadt

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: Replace <sys/param.h> with <limits.h>
	  and other less dirty headers where possible.	Annotate
	  <sys/param.h> lines with their current reasons.  Switch to
	  PATH_MAX, NGROUPS_MAX, HOST_NAME_MAX+1, LOGIN_NAME_MAX, etc.
	  Change MIN() and MAX() to local definitions of MINIMUM() and
	  MAXIMUM() where sensible to avoid pulling in the pollution.
	  These are the files confirmed through binary verification.  ok

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: My previous attempt to chdir(2) to
	  the directory containing the cgi script was not quite right.
	  slowcgi would try to chdir("") with a SCRIPT_NAME of /foo.cgi;
	  chdir("/") in that case.  I'm not sure how one would configure
	  nginx/slowcgi to get to that point though.  OK benno@

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: Calculate the length of name and
	  value for parameters the right way around for the 4 byte
	  encoding. With this QUERY_STRING can be longer than 127 bytes.
	  Found the hard way while playing with smokeping.  OK benno@

2014-04-13 08:46  florian

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: httpd(8) did a chdir(2) to the
	  directory containing the cgi script. As there might be scripts
	  depending on this do the same in slowcgi(8).

	  pointed out and OK ratchov@

2014-03-17 13:39  florian

	* usr.sbin/slowcgi/slowcgi.c: jturner pointed out that if one wants
	  to run cgi scripts outside /cgi-bin SCRIPT_NAME doesn't cut it.
	  The spec says: "The SCRIPT_NAME variable MUST be set to a URL
	  path". Use SCRIPT_FILENAME which can be an absolute filesystem
	  path for these cases and fall back to using SCRIPT_NAME if
	  SCRIPT_FILENAME is not present.  Details how to handle this
	  worked out by jturner and sthen.  Based on an erlier diff by
	  jturner.  Tested by jturner OK jturner, sthen

2013-10-18 14:48  florian
